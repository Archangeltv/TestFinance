          Cryptocurrencies are sets of software protocols for generating digital
          tokens and for tracking transactions in a way that makes it hard to
          counterfeit or re-use tokens. Therefore, cryptocurrency trading
          involves trading on digital currencies/tokens. This form of trading
          has in fact only been around for a few years. One of the most common
          forms of digital currency is the Bitcoin which was released in 2009.
          It's initial price was set at less than 1 cent as at 2010. While it is
          still to experience its boom phase, it has quickly become a popular
          way of trading for many. One of the big benefits of this form of
          trading is the money that there is to be made. The bitcoin, for
          example, hit a market cap of $160 billion by November, 2017. There are
          considerably a few people trading cryptocurrencies which is an
          advantage because the market is yet to be saturated by others trying
          to get in on the game. Deutsche bank has shown an increasing
          appreciation for the transformative potential of both blockchain
          technology—becoming one of the first to spearhead the development of
          its own Ethereum-based blockchain—and the cryptocurrencies based on
          it. Just like Deutsche bank, Germany offers forex broker service, we
          also have cryptocurrency traders that specialize in the trading of
          this digital cash. Our job is to test them all out, put them through
          their paces and then present our information, for better result.

          Real estate trading is the wild side of real estate investment. Like
          day traders, who are distinct from buy-and-hold investors, real estate
          traders are an entirely different breed from buy-and-rent landlords.
          Real estate traders buy properties with the intention of holding them
          for a short period of time, often no more than three to four months,
          after which they hope to sell them for a profit. This technique is
          also called flipping properties and is based on buying properties that
          are either significantly undervalued or in a very hot market. Real
          estate trading has a shorter time period during which capital and
          effort are tied up in a property. Depending on market conditions,
          there can be significant returns even on this shorter time frame. As
          property flippers we often forgo putting any money into a house for
          improvements; the investment has to have the intrinsic value to turn a
          profit without alteration or we won’t consider it. Flipping in this
          manner is a short-term cash investment. To take advantage of
          potentially large returns, We have to have cash on hand, as
          traditional financing doesn’t generally work for this type of
          transaction. A second class of property flipper also exists. These
          investors make their money by buying reasonably priced properties and
          adding value by renovating them. This can be a longer-term investment
          depending on the extent of the improvements. The limiting feature of
          this investment is that it is time intensive and often only allows
          investors to take on one or two properties at a time hence we try to
          avoid properties with high maintenance cost and focus more on
          properties with high undervalue For more Information contact us via
